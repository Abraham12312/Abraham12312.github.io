<p>“What is right from wrong? What is good from evil? Nobody can truly distinguish between them.<br>
  Even if there was a god. Now, supposing a god and his world existed, even then I’d stop and think for myself.<br>
  I’d decide for myself whether his teachings are right or wrong. After all, I am just the same as you.<br>
  I put faith in my own convictions as to what I believe is right, and consider them to be righteous.” – Near</p>

<p>“This world is rotten and those who are making it rot deserve to die.<br>
  Someone has to do it, so why not me? Even if it means sacrificing my own mind and soul, it’s worth it.<br>
  Because the world… can’t go on like this.<br>
  I wonder… what if someone else had picked up this notebook?<br>
  Is there anyone out there other than me who’d be willing to eliminate the vermin from the world?<br>
  If I don’t do it, then who will? That’s just it: there’s no one, but I can do it. In fact,<br>
  I’m the only one who can. I’ll do it. Using the death note, I’ll change the world.” – Light Yagami</p>

<p>There are... many types of monsters in this world: Monsters who will not show themselves and who cause trouble;<br>
  monsters who abduct children; monsters who devour dreams;<br>
  monsters who suck blood, and... monsters who always tell lies.<br>
  Lying monsters are a real nuisance. They are much more cunning than other monsters.<br>
  They pose as humans even though they have no understanding of the human heart.<br>
  They eat even though they've never experienced hunger. They study even though they have no interest in academics.<br>
  They seek friendship even though they do not know how to love. If I were to encounter such a monster,<br>
  I would likely be eaten by it. Because in truth, I am that monster. - L</p>
